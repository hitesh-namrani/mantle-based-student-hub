# STUDENT HUB | Decentralized Campus Ecosystem
# Mantle Global Hackathon Submission 2026

========================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
Student Hub is a decentralized campus management platform built on the 
Mantle Sepolia Testnet. It brings transparency to campus life by handling 
grievances, events, and official notices on the blockchain.

We solve the problem of opaque governance and fragmented communication 
by giving students a verifiable voice through on-chain voting and 
tamper-proof feeds.

KEY FEATURES
------------
1. On-Chain Grievance Portal (DAO):
   Students use $SHT tokens to create proposals and vote on campus issues. 
   Every vote is immutable and recorded on Mantle.

2. Decentralized Community Feed:
   Official notices and updates are stored on-chain to ensure integrity 
   and prevent unauthorized changes.

3. Automated Event Management:
   A seamless dashboard for students to register for campus events with 
   transparent record-keeping.

4. Tokenized Economy ($SHT):
   A utility token representing "Voting Power." Includes a faucet for 
   easy access and admin tools for merit-based distribution.
